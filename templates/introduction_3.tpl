            1. Define the problem you are solving
        </h3>
        <dd><p>
            Defining the problem is critical. It is your North Star and provides direction. Your solution is born from your problem.
        </p></dd>
        <h3>
            2. Plan the workflow of your web application
        </h3>
        <dd><p>
            Once you know your solution, map out the workflow of how it will work. What needs to happen within your web application for it to solve the problem?
        </p></dd>
        <h3>
            3. Wireframe/prototype your web application
        </h3>
        <dd><p>
            Transform your workflow into a wireframe. Your wireframe is simply a tool for communicating your solution to your target user.
        </p></dd>
        <h3>
            4. Receive Validation
        </h3>
        <dd><p>
            Present your wireframe to potential users of your new web application. Record feedback and iterate on the design until you, and your potential users are happy.
        </p></dd>
        <h3>
            5. Choose your firepower
        </h3>
        <dd><p>
            You will use different tools/platforms/frameworks to build your web application. It’s important to choose a tool that fits the job (in this case your web application) and not to go with what is popular. Example - for a simple to-do app, Django combined with React might be overkill.
        </p></dd>
        <h3>
            6. Build your web application
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Database
        </h4>
        <dd><p>
            Determine what data you need to store in your database and also your data types. Then build your database.
        </p></dd>
        <h4>
            Frontend
        </h4>
        <dd><p>
            You will likely build your frontend and backend at the same time. Your frontend will loosely mirror your wireframe/prototype you validated earlier. The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JS - like one of our frontend frameworks below.
        </p></dd>
        <h4>
            Backend
        </h4>
        <dd><p>
            Building your backend is one of the toughest parts of the web application development process. The primary functions of the backend is to provide HTTP endpoints for your frontend (remember CRUD!), authenticate users, authorization, and to serve the frontend.
        </p></dd>
        <h3>
            7. Test your web application
        </h3>
        <dd><p>
            Testing your web application is an ongoing process and usually happens during and after the building phase. You can automate testing or do it manually. During the testing phase you should try to cover functionality, usability, compatibility, security and performance testing.
        </p></dd>
        <h3>
            8. Host and deploy your web application
        </h3>
        <dd><p>
            Hosting involves running your web application on a server. You will need to buy a domain and choose a cloud hosting provider. To get your web application from your local machine to your cloud provider and deploy it, you will need to use a CI tool.
        </p></dd>
